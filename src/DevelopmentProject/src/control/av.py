"""
This is the place to put control code for various types of systems (e.g. AV, Building Management).
The core purpose is for separation of concerns. Each concern should be as isolated as possible,
taking advantage of the framework structure and helper modules.

Examples:

* AV devices
* Building management systems
  * Lighting
  * HVAC
* Cloud Services
